How amazing is he
I am happy

No matter how bad things goes

He always reminds me he is there
I can't have a chance of not believing..


I have felt the magic,
I can see the pattern..


We as conditioned soul will suffer,
As long as we are attached to the white cherry tree,
We are so dazzled by it,
But once we remind ourselves of him..


Sometimes we suffer so that we can see the reality,
Sometimes there is a lesson
It have depth
He wants to keep us close
Letting it go..

 Leaving it on him

Thank you for being there.. 

Thank you for everything..
Love youâ™¥
