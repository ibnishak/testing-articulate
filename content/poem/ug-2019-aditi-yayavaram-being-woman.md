Rise against enormity, Fight for equity. 
Don't be helpless in front of shameless devil, in this world full of evil! 
You are not fragile to be broken like a crystal,you are tough like a wall! And not to be played like a ball! 
You are the mountain of strength. 
Show everyone, that you are not full of fright, but are capable to fight. 
If you are Lakshmi and Saraswati, you could be Durga and Kaali. 
If you are a spark of happiness, you could be the fire of rage. 
Raise yourself and show, NO MEANS NO! 
Promise yourself, no matchstick will burn to light a candle, but It will only burn to light a flambeau of change. 
Prove your benign presence, 
And your worth of Being a Woman!
