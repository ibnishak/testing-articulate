Tears in my dad's eyes 
He was always my pillar when I knew I'd fall,
Always my anchor so strong and tall.
His hard face changes only for me.<!--more-->
His softer side, so careless and free.
He knows my dreams are too big for this place.
His little girl's leaving, ready to begin her race.
He knows I'll be thinking of him wherever I go.

I know I'm ready to do this on my own,
But still I cry and he holds me tight,
He tries to be strong, not a tear in sight.
I'm ready to reach for the stars in the sky.
He's ready to watch his princess fly.
It's time to let go, sure of a path to take,
But now I know, even pillars can break.
For when I drive away, trying to stifle my cries,
All I could see were tears in my father's eyes.
