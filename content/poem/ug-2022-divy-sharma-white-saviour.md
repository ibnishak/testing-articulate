Med-school is very challenging they say,
Yet every student to reach here pray
All the hardships for a common goal.
To become a doctor with a pure soul,
Humungous syllabus that is hard to learn.
With assessments frequently that return,
Sleepless nights and restless days.
To keep learning and improving always,
Defying the odds, crossing the hurdles.
Moving further facing every struggle,
A med-student acquires knowledge
For the desire to take a pledge.
With heart and soul work for humanity,
And not for for some materialistic entity.
Doctors who do so much for the society,
Expect dignity and not brutality.
All the hardships not to get thrashed,
For a mishap not to get slashed.
For their good they are praised,
But for an error they are wrongly appraised.
The journey is long to be called a saviour,
Needs disciplined life and humble behaviour.
All the hardships won't be in vain,
When they will cure a person in pain.
