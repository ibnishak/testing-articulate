Sometimes I get lonely
Instagram, Twitter, Facebook
Always connecting but not connected

Sometimes I get lonely
Looking to the future
Forgetting to be in the present

Sometimes I get lonely
Thinking someday, one day
Never thinking right here, right now

Sometimes I get lonely
Phone's on, WiFi's up
Waiting for it to buzz

Sometimes I get lonely
Just waiting...
Always waiting...
