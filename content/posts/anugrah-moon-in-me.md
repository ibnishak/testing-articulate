Sometimes,
The moon in me gets 
Shadowed under the 
Everlasting sunshine
Of the images of silence 
And sound of the music.
I keep trying to mince
My words into palatable
Fragments but the 
Pragmatic part of myself
Amuses me with the burden
Of truth and jests about my
Failure to deliver the ocean
With a spoon just like 
You can't catch a space
Of stardust with a glance
Of blindness or can't sync 
Your beat to sonata
Rooted in idiosyncrasies
Of a musical prodigy.
