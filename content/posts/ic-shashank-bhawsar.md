Introducing the *Mr. Remarkable* of our college, Shashank Bhawsar, a complete package of talent, charisma and kind heart. The only person in batch 2018 who had the misfortune (or good fortune for his batch - it is all about perspectives) to land in GMC, Ratlam from a more coveted NSCB, Jabalpur. It is only because he believed in making the place better instead of being in a better place. The dedication and determination with which he has carried out his duties would put Captain America to shame. From the tough tasks like co-ordinating 31st night party and impossible tasks like co-ordinating Diwali GT, he made it all happen like a bumpy, adventurous roller coaster ride. Shanky boy as called by his closest friends and Shaank as he goes by his gaming alias was the first PUBG solo winner in the college.

Despite all of these and his innumerable talents and achievements, he remains grounded and humble. He is that kind of a friend who will always be ready to help irrespective of time of day. He is a gem of a friend who you comes once in a lifetime. His infectious laughter and genuine interest in others make him the life of every gathering. Tall, handsome, intelligent, good dancer, singer, swimmer, - I mean move over Brad Pitt.  Riding, sports, e-gaming, parties - arena not graced by his presence is far and few. There isn't a single MBBS related study material that this guy can't find from the depths of whichever void he has personal access to. Avid cricket fan and a fanatic Rohit Sharma fan. 'Chai pine ja raha' is the most strenuous thing he does and he does it at least thrice a day. His joyful nature and not taking everything too seriously is something to learn from. Fair warning! if you meet him, you cannot help but admire.
