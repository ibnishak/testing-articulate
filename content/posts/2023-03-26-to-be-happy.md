To be happy is a matter of choice
We need to be free
Free from the prison of our own thoughts
Escaping from the demon inside us
And illuminating darkness from our light

Pain will always be there lurking
Feeding our memories
But not forging in our thoughts is our choice

We need to choose to smile
Accepting the bitter reality
Staying away from materialistic people
Being happy in disguise
As to be happy is a matter of choice!
