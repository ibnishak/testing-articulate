You divide the world,
in black and white.
But did you ever consider the grey,
where everything unites?
<!--more-->
When you hung a man,
for the sake of what's right.
Didn't you even once think of,
his older mother's plight?

For you what is six,
to me it maybe a nine.
Then who decided what's a virtue,
and what is a crime?

You divide the world,
in black and white.
But did you ever consider the grey,
where everything unites?
