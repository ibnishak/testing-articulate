Love is an emotion we feel too quick.
Time is what we need, this is the trick.

Love will find you when you are ready.
Just enjoy life, take it nice and steady.

The beauty of life is there to be taken.
And when the time is right, your heart will awaken.

Love is not a race, nor a goal;
It's an emotion that touches your soul.

It will fill your life and make it complete.
Be patient and calm, and love you will meet.
