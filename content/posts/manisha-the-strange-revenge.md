Kashish and I (Esha) have been roommates since one and half years. We both have totally different opinions and choices, still we manage to share space in this hostel.
It's Sunday afternoon, and today I decided to complete my favourite novel which I started 20 days before.
"I will not say goodbye, my love will never die....myyyy loveee myyy loveee...."
Suddenly a loud music noise filled my ears.
"Stop singing so loudly kashish and lower the volume of your music player. It will tear my eardrum." I said.
"This is my favourite song Esha, you should enjoy the lyrics rather than shouting about it" she replied in her enthusiastic voice.
"It's your voice girl, which I found irritating. It's making the song much worse" I said.
"Oh my Dear Roomie, if you don't want to hear this marvellous music, you can go straight to hell" she replied.
She sounds ridiculous.
Why is she so irritating, God, why? I hate her.
I took my books and went to the balcony to read.
*Slammed the door*.
One day I'll take revenge on her.
Then I started reading my novel.<br>

After some time Richa Ma'am came there. She's our hostel warden.
And also she is a rich lady, who often wears expensive jewellery.
"How much garbage is spread around your room. Where's your room mate" she asked angrily.
Uh it's 5:12 pm, Kashish goes out daily in the evening.
"She's gone to the park side ma'am". I said
"When she comes back, you two clean up here. Okay?" her tone was bitter.
"Yes ma'am" I said meekly.
Then she turned back. And head to the office room.
While leaving, a ring from her bag fell on the ground.
At that moment a nasty thought came to my mind. I decided to take my revenge.
I put that ring in Kashish's drawer.
The next day the news of missing the ring spread in the hostel.
When everyone's room was searched, the ring was found in her drawer.
Kashish tried to declare her innocence but no one believed her.
She kept crying all day. After a while she left the room. She must have gone for a walk outside, as usual.
I was feeling guilty for what I did. So I decided to tell the truth to everyone as soon as Kashish returned to the hostel.
It was 8 o'clock, yet she has not returned.
Just then my phone rang. It's my hostel mate Neha. I picked it up.
"Eshaa...Kash, kashish has an accident. A truck hit her. By the time the people
around her took her to the hospital, she had lost her life" Neha said.
Her words choked my throat.
I went to the hospital quickly. Kashish's parents, Richa ma'am and a few of our hostel mates already were there. When her mom saw me, she hugged me, and started crying.
How did all this happen?
When I went back to my hostel room.
That room has lost its essence. Kashish's emptiness was killing my soul. Without her this room is just a physical space. My tears continued to flow.
After some time, I turned back to heading to the balcony.
Then I heard somethingâ€¦
"My love, my love... my feel is love,
I will not say goodbye...my love will never die...."
'Revenge is not complete yet'.
It's Kashish's voice.
My feet froze there.
