Aka laal pari aka chana siddiqui.

There is no introduction needed for the first CR of GMC,Ratlam. The girl landed  straight from Dubai in GMC, Ratlam campus dressed in an enchanting red suit and heels - earning her tag *laal pari*. She was and is the representative of batch 2018 and will always be. She has always been an enthusiast who has led the unruly mob that is batch 2018 confidently and bravely. She is very bright, brilliant, beautiful and brainy, definitely a sudoku and crosswords master. She has always been a keen observer and learner. A sleeping beauty of course ( Soo aisa ki 4 log laash smjhe) ,who can sleep through a storm and wake up beaming. One of the most creative mind who has cornered everything from studies to art or making coffee to pen down the most beautiful poems as her forte. And if you thought that is all, think again - her recitation and communication skills will blow your mind. Finding the hidden classic gem songs which can make you fall in love with music again is kinda her thing, not to mention her urge to learn every other musical instrument. 

She is as bubbly and bouncy as her curly hairs.  Fashionably late to parties but she will definitely be the show stopper. She has the most exquisite collection of heels, studs and lipsticks which she wears with the confidence of - well... - Sana. A shopaholic through and through, she will find it in her magnanimity to shop for everyone around her. It is a surprise *The Souled Store* has not yet appointed her as the brand ambassador. The belongs to that irritating tribe who fools you into thinking they are lazy and underprepares but in the last possible moment, tadaa, she pulls out the work miles ahead of nearest competition. When it comes to friendship she is a sincere advisor with five star rating on trustworthiness, always ready to offer her shoulder to lean on and willing to do anything for her close ones. *Sanely Sana* is not so sane but she brightens up the room wherever she walks in. We earnestly know within our hearts that she will carry this vibe for eternity. Also we know she will achieve all the milestones with the same ease and grace in the years ahead too.
