Introducing Mr remarkable of our college, Shashank Bhawsar, a complete package of talent, charisma and kind heart. One of our most favorite CRs. The dedication and determination with which he has done his duties would put Captain America to shame. From the easiest requests to the tough ones he made them all pass like a bumpy, adventurous roller coaster ride. Shanky boy as called by his closest friends and Shaank as he goes by his gaming alias was the first PUBG solo winner in the college.

Yet, despite his many talents and achievements, he remains grounded and humble.One of the most admirable qualities of Shashank's personality is that he listens and understands other people. He always has a knack for looking at another person's problem from a different perspective and providing a solution. An empathetic person who is always on the toes to help others, regardless of the time and situation. His infectious laughter and genuine interest in others makes him the life of every gathering. He is not just a good looking, charming gentleman but a captivating dancer and entertainer, his presence is all you need to make any activity a blast. There isn't a single MBBS related study material that this guy can't find from the depths of whichever void he has personal access to. He was the one responsible for spamming emails to the VC and university and it did work!

An avid cricket fan and a fanatic Rohit Sharma fan. He definitely can't do without chai. His joyful nature and not taking everything too seriously is something to learn from. Fair warning! if you meet him, you cannot help but admire.
