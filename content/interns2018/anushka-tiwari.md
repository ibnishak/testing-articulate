aka soogli aka annu
The girl from the city of Mahakaal. You can take Annu out of Ujjain but not Ujjain out of Annu.

This multi-talented girl has a plethora of skills, spanning from art, dance, literature - you name it.  From the very beginning, she has taken up every opportunity with nothing less than utter dedication. She has a dynamic personality and is a true genius with infinite curiosity and eagerness to keep learning forever. The same curiosity has led her down the path of research and even publishing her own research paper. A classical dancer who is great at sketching and writing and is an avid reader whose doodles can make you smile even during the toughest times - it is almost as if there is nothing she cannot do. She is passionate about photography and most definitely is a selenophile. After all, she is our very own in-house "Dora the Explorer". 

She is bright, brilliant, fierce, and not shy of speaking what's on her mind. Chai is her lifeline and loves pasta but but butâ€¦ gluten allergy alert. And what can we say about her driving skills, *Fast and Furious* franchise is planning to launch her in their India edition. She is a shoe maniac, crazy about those kicks, and can easily spend an entire Sunday cleaning up her beloved shoe collection. But her superpower is that she can choose to not see you by simply removing her glasses. She is an amazing friend, your ultimate go-to person to whom you can rant about anything and everything and we believe that she will do something great in the future.
