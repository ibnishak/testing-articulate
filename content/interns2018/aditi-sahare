This girl from Jabalpur is the real deal! She has gained quite a reputation as the best female gamer in the college dominating the field of BGMI. She's a night owl and waking up in the morning seems to be the most daunting task for her. But hey, who needs sleep when you've got BGMI to play, right?

With a flair for fashion, she provides valuable advice in that domain as well. Apart from that she's got the brains to ace her academics. She's got a habit of studying at the last minute, but somehow still manages to achieve impressive results. She possesses not only a great personality, but also exceptional understanding and listening skills that foster engaging conversations. And... let's not forget her hilarious sarcasm, which adds some extra spice to your conversations. 

However, when it comes to attending classes, she's like a ghost. You'll never see her in the classroom but if she does attends the class you can always rely on her for proxies. 

She is one of the most caring person to meet and above all, if you ever need a helping hand, she is your girl and is always there to help you.
