So, if you are fortunate enough to be in her company, consider yourself blessed. Sola is a mix of being organised and a bit clumsy. She might have a perfectly planned schedule and everything organised but she's also prone to the occasional act of clumsiness. It adds charm to her character and It happens to the best of us! Hygiene is one of her top most priorities , you will never find a person as clean as her. Always carrying tissues and sanitizer in her bag. 

By the way Sola's love for Blue lays chips is an embodiment of her vibrant personalityâ€”"bold, unique, and always delighting those around her."
