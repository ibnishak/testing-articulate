Aka nandu.

How do we introduce one of the prettiest girls with the most magnificent smile? Nandini is simply brilliant and hardworking and most importantly dedicated with all heart and soul towards her goals. She is strong and independant and the most poised, balanced person you’ll ever meet! She is the sweetest but tread with care, for her savage and quick witted replies can kill you. She has a melodious voice and her elegant dance moves have been the cause of several cases of atrial flutter. Her beautiful paintings are the only things that can reasonably compete with her smiles and her graceful handwriting is just icing on the cake! Her biggest asset and talent is that she’s a great multi-tasker -  as if she has four hands… and does all that with a smile on her face and her ‘thug life’ glasses on. Basically she’s a legend who knows how to enjoy her life without compromising with her work and has just a single weakness - chocolates!. She’s great at time management - which is ironic because she takes forever to finish a meal. Her life’s motto is ‘ye sab moh maya hai’.  When you can't find her anywhere or reach her cell, go and look in the library. 
  
When it comes to friendship, she’s an extremely supportive friend and always lends an ear and has kind words to comfort you even in the toughest of times. And her ‘never say never’ attitude makes her stand apart in a crowd and will surely lead her miles and miles toward success. In the end it is safe to say, ‘dil le gayi kudi gujrat di’!
