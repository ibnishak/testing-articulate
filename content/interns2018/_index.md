As we approach the bittersweet moment of bidding farewell to our dear friends in few months, we realize that life's journey often takes us in different directions. While it may be unlikely that we will cross paths with most of them again, what remains eternally are the cherished memories and the qualities that made our friendships so special. In this small yet significant initiative made through this magazine, we aim to capture the essence of our dear buddies and celebrate the bond we shared. Let us embark on this heartfelt journey to honor our forever friends.._kyuki yahi batein to baad me yaad aaegi!_. - Samarpit Patidar
