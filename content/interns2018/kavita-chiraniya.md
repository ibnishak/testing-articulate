Aka kavu comes from city of the queen Devi Ahilya Bai (Indore), which absolutely justifies her boldness and leadership qualities!She is definitely a chota packet bada dhamaka. This egg faced girl is a perfect example of beauty with brains. Our "TOPPER OF PHYSIOLOGY", the gold medalist aka chirantology engraved her name in departmental achiever's list in her 1st proff itself and even remains  amongst the toppers of her batch throughout. A Multi-tasker girl besides being the brand ambassador of MARROW for the college, very well balances between her studies, fun , outings, being a part of cultural activities and even her slumbering habits. 

She is the best senior for nearly all her junior's during their gloomy phases..Her immaculate precision has saved many souls even  a day before the proff exams. A trustworthy, gracious , empathetic person who posses all the skills to manage everything all together - truly a masterpiece. She has always stood by her friends, be it systole or diastole. The only "*taunt marke sikhane wali mummy*" you'll ever meet. Her room has been a common place for chitchats and testifying our culinary arts, as her bhel making skills are so amazing that it will rock your tastebuds. A die heart fan of love stories, momos and paani puri. She posses one of those ability to finish all her file work before time and is ready to share with others, a quality rarely found in others. This "only child"  of her parents has already made them proud with her marvellous achievements and we wish her all the very best to add more to their pride with her accomplishments. We wish her a bright future and a successful journey as a great doc.
