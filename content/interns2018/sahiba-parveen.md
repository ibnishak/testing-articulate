Sahiba aka mamma

The one person you can always count on! She has a vibrant personality and is always there for everyone. Just like her big heart her room has always been a safe space with immense warmth for her close ones and magically makes one’s life easier. You can always pour your heart out to her and she will always come up with an advice for you... sane or insane advice is another question altogether! Food is her love language - from momos to pancakes to chicken biryani - her day revolves around the hope “kuch achcha khane ko mil jaaye”. She is our very own michelin star chef pushing out delicacies at a dizzying pace and making it look effortless. Her human resource management skills are top notch . She is a total social butterfly and is always the life of the party with her sizzling moves! She is a very sincere and punctual person utterly dedicated towards her studies and work.She has gorgeous lively brown eyes (and her fanclub will vouch for it with their lives!) but she tends to fill them up at the slightest hint of emotional affliction! Speaking of her fanclub ,there is an entire playlist of “Sahiba songs” dedicated to her. She earned her shopaholic degree with a specialisation in jhumkas.

She is definitely going to be a great gynaecologist and the department would be very lucky to have her. Other departments need not worry. With her impressive resume of ailments she will be brighten up your department too! She is an instagram buff and all our college life memories have been carefully preserved on her instagram profile. Hard to believe? Go check it out yourself [@insane insaan](https://www.instagram.com/_insane__insaan_/). Her college life being mostly a roller coaster made her into this beautiful human with all the courage. Wherever she goes from here, we are sure she’ll bring lots of love and life to those around her!
