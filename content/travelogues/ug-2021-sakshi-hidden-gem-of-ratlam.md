The best time to visit paradise valley is during July September when nature is at its rawest due to rain. You just need a day, so instead of getting bored at the hostel take your ride 15 km (about 9.32 mi) away from campus to Sanwlia Rundi to reward yourself with the warmth of nature.

The smell of luscious green and soothing sound of waterfall will make you feel like you are visiting a fairyland. The pool created by the cascade is shallow, you may embrace the ripples of water from hitting the rock but be cautious of slippery wet rocks while you decide to go down. The foliage surrounding the waterfall and momentary clouds which skirt the horizon is the best picnic spot. Bring along some edibles
to enjoy with your gang.

As the place is not so popular thus lack of crowds and its quietness is the excellent escape from the regular chaos.
