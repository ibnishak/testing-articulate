> “It was strange. No matter how much I think about it, it still is. How can I end up in that attic every night ? John says I am probably sleep-walking and told me to consult a doctor. But I am not!. I know I'm not. I feel it, someone taking me up there."<br>"‘Jenny! Jenny!’ Peter is calling me. He is a good man. At least he doesn’t call me mad for all these things. He gives me medicines. They make me feel better.”

Police found this letter from the women’s diary. She was found dead along with many other women in the dusty attic of her house. Her husband was behind all these murders. The doctor said he was probably a psychopath. He tried to give her medicine and took her up the attic every night but couldn’t kill her. But he finally did it. It is a dusty attic.
